Create a micro transaction mobile application.

###Description:###

1. This application allows transfer of funds from one person to other.
2.  We will create an application that gives a unique code to each  of the user, a transaction can take place between two users with just  sharing of the 4 digit pin.
3. The main use case of this  application can be at places where the seller is not able to return  change to customer, he can use this application to transfer change to  customer.
4. We can place a limit on maximum amount that can be transferred, this way limiting only to small amount transactions.
5. Once an upper limit on account is received, we can easily transfer funds to the user's bank account.
6. We will create a really simple application that allows transfer  of funds using a very basic GUI that only has a form for entering the  pin of the receiving person.
7. We can create a web panel for managing accounts and other stuff.
